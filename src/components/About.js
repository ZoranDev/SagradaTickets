          It is also very important to consider what to wear on your visit.
          Aside from being a highly visited tourist attraction, it is still a
          church, and so churchlike rules apply and there is a dress code to be
          able to enter, for men and women alike:
        </p>
        <ul className="w-full mb-5 px-10 list-disc text-lg">
          <li>Avoid wearing flip flops. </li>
          <li>
            All caps, hats or head scarves should be removed before going inside
            the basilica (if you wear them for religious reasons, it is allowed,
            i. e., hijab or yarmulke).
          </li>
          <li>T-shirts and blouses have to cover your shoulders.</li>
          <li>Shorts and short skirts are not allowed. </li>
          <li>
            See-through clothes and freely plunging necklines are not permitted.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-5 text-lg text-justify">
          Did you know you can visit the Crypt inside la Sagrada Familia?
          Although it is open to visit during limited times you can enter it in
          the following schedule:
        </p>
        <ul className="w-full mb-5 px-10 list-disc text-lg">

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-5 text-lg text-justify">
          You should also consider to purchase the ticket option that includes
          the visit up the towers. It will give you a breathtaking and unique
          view of Barcelona that only a few choose to enjoy. An elevator takes
          you up the tower, but you can pick to climb down the spiraling
          staircase if you prefer to do so.

          And last but not least, it is not the same experience to go for the

          La Sagrada Família has many features, and one of the most beautiful
          ones is the use of light that Gaudi gave it. The building has large
          stained-glass windows that showers the naves with different tones of
          colour. The “special effects” is most noticeable and striking
          mid-morning and mid to late afternoon when the sunlight hits the
          windows directly.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="mb-5 text-lg text-justify">
          Also when planning your trip, you should try to choose to go between
          early spring, fall or winter to visit Barcelona in general, during the
          summer the city is usually with high temperatures and fairly crowded.
          So keep this in mind for your trip plans.{" "}

            La Sagrada Família has a total of eighteen spires, more commonly
            known and the towers. They are dedicated as follows: twelve to the
            Twelve Apostles and are situated on the three façades of the church;
            the other six spires represent the Four Evangelists, Virgin Mary and
            Jesus Christ. There are only eight completed towers from the total
            of eighteen spires. The ones that are finished correspond to the
            four Apostles on the Nativity Façade, and the ones on the Passion
            Façade. From the eighteen towers the tallest of them all will be the
            one that represents Jesus Christ, surmounted by an enormous cross
            with a height of 170 meters (560 ft).

          <p className="mb-5 text-lg text-justify">
            To visit the Sagrada Família Towers there are some considerations
            you should know beforehand:

            <li>
              The standard ticket does not include access to the Towers. There
              is a ticket available with access to the Towers.{" "}
            </li>
            <li>
              The Nativity and the Passion façade are not joined together, so
              the access to the spires are in different places.
            </li>
            <li>
              To get to the top of the towers it is only accessible via an
              elevator, one for each façade.
            </li>
            <li>
              Visitors have to take the stairs down the spires, on both of the
              Nativity and Passion façade.
